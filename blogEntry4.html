                            <p>
                                <em>January 6, 2024</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's been a while since I updated, and I'm not really sure what to say. But just to brain dump, I did make a more useful project for myself recently. A fantasy football GroupMe Bot, that helps tremendously for a a fantasy football league I'm a manager of. Holidays just ended, it was great. I got to see family, some friends, and also my birthday did recently pass. I realize not many people will read this, and even less will read this far, so I don't feel it's important to care much about writing PII, a term I've recently learned in my current job because of how secure it has to be now. But, just thinking about how I set up this website, it would be nice to find a way to do this easier. I'm getting more motivation to do more projects and improve this site more recently. So stay tuned, and hopefully this website does get better, and I find out more things to learn about and make projects about. But I'm rambling now, so will end it here. If you've read this far, thanks, and have a great day. Looking forward to 2025.
